# Hello, I'm Ramzi Masri

I'm currently studying at Northeastern University and I'm majoring in Data Science and Economics. I'm very passionate about Data Analysis and the creative approaches you can take to innovate. My interests extend to Economics, more specifically making decisions based on market changes, and economics of crime.
